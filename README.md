# intro-react-native
My first react native app:

Run instructions for iOS:
    • cd /Users/abisht/Desktop/introreactnative && react-native run-ios
     -or-
    • Open ios/introreactnative.xcodeproj in Xcode
    • Hit the Run button

 Run instructions for Android:
    • Have an Android emulator running (quickest way to get started), or a device connected.
    • cd /Users/abisht/Desktop/introreactnative && react-native run-android
